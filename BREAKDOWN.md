# File Sharing System Implementation Breakdown

## Overview
We'll implement a secure file sharing system where:
1. New users see an empty dashboard with "Share File" option
2. File uploads show a loader/spinner
3. Successful uploads enable a "View Files" button
4. Each file has a three-dot menu with sharing options
5. Sharing requires a key/phrase for access control
6. Recipients need the phrase to view shared files

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Dashboard UI Enhancement
- Create empty state UI for new users
- Add "Share File" button prominently on empty dashboard
- Implement file upload component with loader/spinner
- Add "View Files" button that appears after successful upload

### 2. File Management UI
- Display uploaded files in a list/grid view
- Add three-dot menu to each file
- Implement file actions menu (share, delete, etc.)

### 3. File Sharing Functionality
- Create sharing modal/dialog when share action is selected
- Implement key/phrase generation or manual entry
- Store sharing information in database with file reference

### 4. Access Control System
- Create API endpoint to verify access keys/phrases
- Implement view protection for shared files
- Add UI for entering access phrase when accessing shared files

### 5. Backend API Development
- Create upload API with proper response for UI feedback
- Develop sharing API that handles key/phrase authentication
- Implement file retrieval API with access control

### 6. Database Schema
- User table with authentication info
- Files table with owner reference
- Shares table linking files, recipients, and access phrases

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React components for UI elements
- Backend: API endpoints for file operations and sharing
- Storage: AWS S3 for file storage
- Database: Schema for users, files, and sharing permissions
