## Local Deployment for insta-QR

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Junnygram/qr-code/tree/start
   cd qr-code
   ```

---

### Step 2: Set Up and Test the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the backend folder and install the Python packages:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**  
   Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured in `~/.aws/credentials`:

   ```plaintext
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = <your-access-key>
   aws_secret_access_key = <your-secret-access-key>
   ```

3. **Set Up S3 Bucket**

   - Create an S3 bucket named `qr-codes-generator`. Update `bucket_name` in `backend/main.py` if a different name is used.
   - Enable public access and add the following bucket policy for public read access:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Action": "s3:GetObject",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::qr-codes-generator/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

4. **Run the Backend Locally**  
   Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

### Step 3: Set Up and Test the Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the frontend folder and install Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend Locally**  
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Step 4: Containerize and Run with Docker Compose

1. **Create a `.env` File**  
   Add your AWS credentials in the root `.env` file:

   ```env
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
   AWS_REGION=<your-region>
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=qr-codes-generator
   ```

2. **Run Docker Compose**  
   Build and run the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   To stop the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

3. **Testing**
   - Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Upload QR codes and verify they appear in your S3 bucket.

---

### Notes and Tips:

- If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails, use:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Ensure the `bucket_name` in `backend/main.py` matches the S3 bucket name.
- You can rerun the containers later without rebuilding by running:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

This workflow ensures a seamless local deployment and makes the project ready for production deployment. Let me know if you need more details or troubleshooting tips!

### Next Steps: Deploying on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

#### Step 1: Push Docker Images to Amazon ECR

1. **Locate Docker Images**
   Use the following command to search for images with `insta_qr` in their names:

   ```bash
   docker ps -a | grep "insta_qr"
   ```

2. **Log In to ECR**
   Authenticate Docker to your ECR registry:

   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

3. **Create ECR Repositories**
   Create repositories for the frontend and backend images:

   ```bash
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name insta_qr-frontend --region us-east-1
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name insta_qr-backend --region us-east-1
   ```

4. **Tag and Push Images**
   Tag the frontend and backend images, then push them to ECR:

   ```bash
   docker tag insta_qr-frontend:latest <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/insta_qr-frontend:latest
   docker push <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/insta_qr-frontend:latest

   docker tag insta_qr-backend:latest <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/insta_qr-backend:latest
   docker push <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/insta_qr-backend:latest
   ```

---

#### Step 2: Create an Amazon EKS Cluster

An Amazon EKS cluster serves as the foundation for running your Kubernetes workloads. Within the cluster, you can define deployments, pods, services, ingresses, and other Kubernetes resources to manage your application.

1. **Install Required Tools**

   - Install the official Kubernetes CLI tool, `kubectl`.
   - Install `eksctl`, a CLI tool to manage EKS clusters.
   - Refer to their [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for installation steps.

2. **Set Up the EKS Cluster**

   - Follow AWS's EKS setup documentation to create a cluster with proper node groups, networking, and IAM roles.

3. **Deploy the Application**
   - Apply Kubernetes manifests (e.g., deployments, services) using `kubectl`.
   - Ensure the application connects to your ECR-hosted Docker images.

Let me know if you'd like detailed steps for setting up Kubernetes manifests or automating this process!

### **Step 1: Create the EKS Cluster**

The command you provided:

```bash
eksctl create cluster \
  --name insta-qr-cluster \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --nodegroup-name standard-workers \
  --node-type t3.medium \
  --nodes 3 \
  --nodes-min 1 \
  --nodes-max 3

```

- **`eksctl create cluster`**: This command creates an Amazon EKS cluster.
- **`--name insta-qr-cluster`**: The cluster will be named `insta-qr-cluster`.
- **`--region us-east-1`**: The cluster will be deployed in the `us-east-1` AWS region.
- **`--nodegroup-name standard-workers`**: Defines a worker node group with the name `standard-workers`.
- **`--node-type t3.medium`**: Specifies the EC2 instance type to use for the worker nodes (in this case, `t3.medium`).
- **`--nodes 3`**: Initially creates 3 nodes in the worker node group.
- **`--nodes-min 1 --nodes-max 3`**: Ensures that the number of nodes will be within the range of 1 to 3, allowing auto-scaling if required.

This process typically takes about **10 minutes** to complete.

---

### **Step 2: Update Kubernetes Config**

Once the cluster is created, the following command updates your local Kubernetes config to communicate with the newly created EKS cluster:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name insta-qr-cluster
```

- **`aws eks update-kubeconfig`**: Configures `kubectl` (the Kubernetes CLI tool) to interact with the EKS cluster.
- **`--region us-east-1`**: Specifies the AWS region where your cluster is deployed.
- **`--name insta-qr-cluster`**: Specifies the name of the EKS cluster to use for the `kubectl` context.

After running this command, you can interact with your EKS cluster using `kubectl` commands.

---

### **Step 3: Apply Kubernetes Deployment and Service Configurations**

You have two deployment configurations: one for the frontend (`frontend.yml`) and one for the backend (`backend.yml`) in k8s folder .

#### **frontend.yml**

The `frontend.yml` manifest contains two resources: a **Deployment** and a **Service**.

1. **Deployment:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: frontend-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: frontend
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: frontend
       spec:
         imagePullSecrets:
           - name: regcred
         containers:
           - name: frontend-container
             image: '307946680662.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/insta_qr-frontend'
             imagePullPolicy: Always
             ports:
               - containerPort: 3000
   ```

   - **`Deployment`**: This defines the deployment of your frontend application.
   - **`replicas: 1`**: It specifies that only 1 pod should be running for the frontend application (you can scale this based on traffic).
   - **`image`**: The container image for the frontend is pulled from Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
   - **`imagePullPolicy: Always`**: This ensures that Kubernetes always pulls the latest version of the image from ECR.
   - **`ports`**: Exposes port 3000 inside the container, which is the port your frontend application is listening on.

2. **Service:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: frontend-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     selector:
       app: frontend
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 3000
   ```
   - **`Service`**: This exposes your frontend application to the outside world.
   - **`type: LoadBalancer`**: Specifies that the service will be exposed via an AWS load balancer (which will route external traffic to your frontend).
   - **`port: 80`**: Exposes port 80 for HTTP traffic.
   - **`targetPort: 3000`**: Forwards traffic from port 80 to port 3000 inside the frontend container.

#### **backend.yml**

The `backend.yml` manifest also contains two resources: a **Deployment** and a **Service**.

1. **Deployment:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: backend-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: backend
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: backend
           monitoring: enabled
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: backend-container
             image: '307946680662.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/insta_qr-backend'
             imagePullPolicy: Always
             ports:
               - containerPort: 8000
   ```

   - **`Deployment`**: This defines the deployment of your backend application.
   - **`replicas: 1`**: Similar to the frontend, only 1 replica is being created for the backend (you can scale this based on demand).
   - **`image`**: The backend container image is also pulled from Amazon ECR.
   - **`imagePullPolicy: Always`**: Ensures that the backend container image is always updated.
   - **`ports`**: Exposes port 8000 inside the container, which is where the backend application listens for incoming requests.

2. **Service:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: backend-service
     labels:
       app: backend
       monitoring: enabled
   spec:
     selector:
       app: backend
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 8000
         targetPort: 8000
         name: http
     type: ClusterIP
   ```
   - **`Service`**: This defines how the backend will be exposed within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - **`type: ClusterIP`**: This makes the service accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - **`port: 8000`**: Exposes port 8000 for internal communication.
   - **`targetPort: 8000`**: Routes traffic from port 8000 to port 8000 inside the container.

---

### **Step 4: Apply the Configuration**

Once the cluster is ready and the config is updated, apply the deployment and service configurations with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend.yml
kubectl apply -f k8s/backend.yml
```

This will create the necessary deployments and services for both your frontend and backend.

---

### **Summary**

- **Frontend Deployment**: Creates a pod running the frontend application and exposes it via an external LoadBalancer.
- **Backend Deployment**: Creates a pod running the backend API, which is only accessible internally within the cluster.
- **Frontend and Backend Services**: Expose the pods for external and internal communication respectively, with the frontend service being LoadBalancer-type and the backend service being ClusterIP-type.

implementing reverse proxy

Reverse Proxy in NextJS

To enable communication between the two pods, and because our frontend uses NextJS, we will be utilizing the reverse proxy in NextJS to forward requests from the frontend service to the backend.

    You can find the configuration in the “frontend/next.config.js“ file. replace the placeholder with the name of your backend service

Reverse Proxy

    Position: Sits between the client (user) and the server but in front of the web servers (i.e., on the server side).

    Purpose: The reverse proxy is used to manage and distribute requests to multiple backend servers on behalf of the server. The client doesn't know which server will respond; it interacts only with the reverse proxy.

    Use Cases:
        Load balancing: Distributes incoming traffic among several backend servers to ensure even load distribution.
        Security: Can act as a security barrier between the client and backend servers (e.g., hiding server details, protecting against DDoS attacks).
        SSL termination: Handles SSL encryption/decryption, offloading this task from backend servers.
        Caching: Caches content to improve server performance.

    Example: A reverse proxy might be used to route requests to different microservices or backend servers based on the URL path or load distribution.


     now we
     Update the Frontend Code to use the proxy and rebuild your docker image using the push commands to have the latest changes updated to your container image repository.

```

     aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
     docker tag insta_qr-frontend:latest <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/insta_qr-frontend:latest
      docker push <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/insta_qr-frontend:latest
```

eg.
change from this
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/generate-qr-image/',

to this
const response = await fetch('/api/proxy-image',

    Also, ensure that the bucket policy allows access.

{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/eksctl-instaQR-eks-cluster-nodegro-NodeInstanceRole-I0cyWLXl1M91"
},
"Action": "s3:PutObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::qr-codes-generator/*"
}
]
}

restart the Kubernetes deployment to pick up the latest changes.

kubectl rollouut restart deployment

. Find the IAM Role for Your EKS Worker Nodes

The IAM role you need corresponds to the role created when you set up your EKS cluster with eksctl. It typically has a name like eksctl-<cluster-name>-NodeInstanceRole.
Option 1: Using AWS Management Console

    Go to the IAM Console in AWS.
    In the left-hand navigation pane, click Roles.
    Search for a role with the name eksctl-<your-cluster-name>-NodeInstanceRole. For example, if your cluster is named instaQR, the role would likely be named eksctl-insta-qr-cluster-nodegroup--NodeInstanceRole.
    Click on the role to view its details.
    Copy the Role ARN at the top of the role's summary page. It will look something like:


    arn:aws:iam::307946680662:role/eksctl-insta-qr-cluster-nodegroup--NodeInstanceRole-eqGBUfwgnsJr

Here's the policy with sensitive information removed, ready to be added to your documentation:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "<role-arn>"
      },
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of placeholders:

- `<your-bucket-name>`: Replace this with the actual name of your S3 bucket.
- `<role-arn>`: Replace this with the ARN of the IAM role you want to grant `s3:PutObject` permissions.

This version removes sensitive information like specific IAM role ARNs and bucket names, so it can be safely shared in your documentation.

kubectl rollout restart deployment

To delete an EKS cluster and everything associated with it, follow these steps:
Using eksctl

The simplest way to delete the cluster and all associated resources (e.g., nodes, node groups, VPC) is with eksctl:
Here’s the improved version of your guide with better structure, grammar, and flow:

---

Here’s the updated version, with the instructions for creating a dynamic namespace variable in Grafana included seamlessly:

---

### 1. **Install Helm**

First, you need to install Helm on your macOS system. The following method uses Homebrew, which is the easiest way to install Helm.

```bash
brew install helm
```

If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it from [here](https://brew.sh/).

---

### 2. **Add Helm Repositories for Prometheus and Grafana**

After Helm is installed, add the Prometheus and Grafana Helm repositories:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
```

---

### 3. **Install Prometheus Stack**

To install the Prometheus stack (which includes Prometheus, Alertmanager, Node Exporter, Kube State Metrics, and Grafana), run:

```bash
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --version 45.7.1 --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

- This installation creates a `monitoring` namespace and deploys the Prometheus stack components.

To confirm installation:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

To get services in monitoring namespace:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n monitoring
```

To expose Grafana and Prometheus locally:

```bash
# Expose Prometheus
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090 -n monitoring

# kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-kube-operated 9090:9090 -n monitoring

# Expose Grafana
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
```

Default Grafana credentials:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `prom-operator`

If the credentials don’t work, retrieve the password:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n monitoring prometheus-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode; echo
```

---

### 4. **Add Prometheus as a Data Source in Grafana**

1. Open Grafana in your browser (http://localhost:3000).
2. Login using the default credentials.
3. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Data Sources** → **Add Data Source**.
4. Select **Prometheus**.
5. Set the URL to:
   ```text
   http://prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus.default.svc.cluster.local:9090
   ```
6. Click **Save & Test**.

---

### 5. **Add a Variable for Dynamic Namespaces**

To dynamically populate data for different namespaces in your Grafana dashboard:

#### Create a Namespace Variable:

1. Navigate to your Grafana Dashboard.
2. Go to **Settings** → **Variables** → **Add Variable**.
3. Configure the variable as follows:
   - **Name**: `namespace`
   - **Type**: `Query`
   - **Data Source**: Your Prometheus data source.
   - **Query**:
     ```promql
     label_values(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, container_label_io_kubernetes_pod_namespace)
     ```
4. Click **Save**.

#### Use the Variable in Panels:

1. In your dashboard panels, update the query to include the `namespace` variable. Example:
   ```promql
   sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="$namespace"}[5m]))
   ```
2. Save the panel and test the namespace dropdown.

---

### 6. **Create Custom Dashboards**

1. To create a custom dashboard, click **New Dashboard** → **Add New Panel**.
2. Choose the visualization type (e.g., Time Series).
3. Add queries using Prometheus metrics such as:
   - `http_server_requests_total`
   - `http_request_duration_seconds_count`
   - `process_cpu_seconds_total`
   - `process_memory_bytes`
4. Use the `namespace` variable in queries to filter data dynamically.

### Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline for Our Workflow

Manually restarting deployments, rebuilding Docker images, and pushing to Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for every code change can be tedious and error-prone, especially with frequent and incremental updates. To simplify and automate this process, we’ll set up a **CI/CD pipeline** that ensures efficient and reliable deployment with minimal manual intervention.

---

### Why a CI/CD Pipeline?

- **Automation:** Reduces repetitive tasks like rebuilding images and restarting deployments.
- **Consistency:** Minimizes human error and ensures the same process is followed every time.
- **Efficiency:** Tracks changes, organizes the workflow, and speeds up deployment cycles.

Since our codebase is hosted on **GitHub**, **GitHub Actions** is the natural choice for CI/CD. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub repositories and allows automation of tasks. Alternatives include **AWS CodePipeline**, **Jenkins**, and **CircleCI**.

---

### Setting Up GitHub Actions

1. **Locate the GitHub Actions Workflow File**  
   In your project’s root directory, locate the `.github/workflows` folder. Inside, you should find the `ci-cd.yml` file. Below is the updated configuration for your CI/CD pipeline:

   ```yaml
   name: ECR Build and Deploy to EKS
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main # Trigger the workflow when changes are pushed to the main branch

   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       strategy:
         matrix:
           service: [frontend, backend] # Matrix for frontend and backend services

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Configure AWS credentials from Secrets
           uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
           with:
             aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
             aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
             aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

         - name: Login to Amazon ECR
           run: |
             aws ecr get-login-password --region ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}.amazonaws.com

         - name: Build and Tag Docker Image
           run: |
             IMAGE_TAG=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
             docker build -t insta-${{ matrix.service }}:${IMAGE_TAG} ./${{ matrix.service }}
             docker tag insta-${{ matrix.service }}:${IMAGE_TAG} ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}.amazonaws.com/insta-${{ matrix.service }}:${IMAGE_TAG}
           env:
             IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}

         - name: Push Docker Image to ECR
           run: |
             docker push ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}.amazonaws.com/insta-${{ matrix.service }}:${IMAGE_TAG}
           env:
             IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}

         - name: Set up kubeconfig
           run: |
             mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
             echo "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}" | base64 -d > $HOME/.kube/config
             chmod 600 $HOME/.kube/config

         - name: Deploy to EKS
           run: |
             kubectl set image deployment/${{ matrix.service }}-deployment ${{ matrix.service }}-container=${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}.amazonaws.com/insta-${{ matrix.service }}:${IMAGE_TAG} --record

         - name: Verify Deployment Rollout
           run: |
             kubectl rollout status deployment/${{ matrix.service }}-deployment
   ```

2. **Secure Environment Variables**

   - Remove the `.env` file from your project to avoid exposing sensitive credentials.
   - Add these credentials to **GitHub Secrets** by navigating to:  
     **GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
   - Required secrets include:
     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
     - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
     - `AWS_REGION`
     - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
     - `KUBECONFIG` (base64-encoded kubeconfig file).

3. **Retrieve and Add Your Kubeconfig File**  
   To grant your pipeline access to the Kubernetes cluster:
   - Retrieve the `kubeconfig` file from your local machine:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.kube/config | base64
     ```
   - Copy the output and add it to GitHub Secrets as a new key named `KUBECONFIG`.

---

### Testing the Pipeline

Push your changes to GitHub. Once the workflow runs successfully, you should see the following:

1. Code changes are automatically built into a new Docker image tagged with a unique Git SHA.
2. The image is pushed to Amazon ECR.
3. Kubernetes deployments for both `frontend` and `backend` are updated seamlessly.
4. The pipeline verifies successful rollout using Kubernetes.

---

### Summary

In this guide, we covered:
